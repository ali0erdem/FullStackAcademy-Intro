<h1>TRAVEL AND LANGUAGE</h1>

<p>
    When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first 
    brought me to their home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. 
    Each has given me a unique learning experience.

    At five, I marveled at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights. When I was eight, 
    I stood in the heart of Piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons, 
    then glided down Venetian waterways on sleek gondolas. At thirteen, I saw the ancient, 
    megalithic structure of Stonehenge and walked along the Great Wall of China, 
    amazed that the thousand-year-old stones were still in place.

<p>It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first became interested in language.</p>
